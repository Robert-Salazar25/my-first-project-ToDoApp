### 🎯 Why This Project Stands Out in My Portfolio  

**Advanced Techniques:** 

- Precise alarm scheduling with AlarmManager  
- Interactive widget with real-time updates  
- Repository pattern for data abstraction  

**Best Practices:**  

- Modularized and testable code  
- Proper permission handling (Android 13+)
